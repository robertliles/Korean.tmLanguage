Korean.tmbundle
==============

Sublime Text sytax highlighting support for Korean. Highlighting designed to emphasize grammatical units (particles, modifying clauses, etc.) to facilitate human translation. Work in progress.

Includes both the compiled plist format required by Sublime and the simplified YAML that can be compiled using [PackageDev](https://github.com/SublimeText/PackageDev).
